    - rule: rule_this_server
      text: Some cards refer to the server where they are located (or the central server corresponding to the zone where they are located) using the phrase "this server". If an ability is initiated by a trigger condition or cost involving the ability's source card moving from a server, its root, or protecting it to another server or to a location not associated with any server, treat "this server" as referring to the server associated with the previous location of the card throughout resolution of that ability. If an ability moves its source card while it is resolving, continue to interpret "this server" based on the card's previous location.
      examples:
      - text: The Runner trashes a rezzed {card:Warroid Tracker}. This meets the trigger condition of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s ability, but by the time a checkpoint is resolved and an instance of the ability would become pending, {card:Warroid Tracker} itself is no longer installed. The use of "this server" in the trigger condition still refers to the server from which {card:Warroid Tracker} was trashed, not to the server of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s new location in Archives.

      - text: The Corp uses {card:Nanisivik Grid} to turn a facedown {card:Border Control} in Archives faceup and resolve its first subroutine. {card:Border Control} was not moved between servers, so "this server" in that subroutine refers to Archives.
        local_text: 公司使用{card:纳尼西维克网阵}，将档案库中一张牌面朝下的{card:边境管控}翻转至牌面朝上，并结算其第一条子进程。由于{card:边境管控}并没有在服务器之间转移，因此该子进程中的“本服务器”指代档案库。
      local_text: 一些卡牌会使用“本服务器”指代其所在的服务器（或与其所在区域对应的中央服务器）。如果一项能力通过触发条件或费用发动，且该条件或费用涉及将此能力的来源卡牌从某台服务器、或是其根目录、或是保护该服务器的位置，移动到另一台服务器，或移动到不与任何服务器相关的位置，则在该能力结算的整个过程中，“本服务器”视为指代与其所在卡牌先前的位置相关联的服务器。如果一项能力在结算过程中移动了其来源卡牌，则仍然根据卡牌之前的位置解释“本服务器”。

      text: If an ability on a card currently or previously located in a server, its root, or protecting it  refers to "another server", this means any server except "this server" as interpreted by {ref:rule_this_server}. If a card's abilities involve choosing a server, "another server" in a linked ability means any server except the chosen server. If neither of the previous cases apply and a run is in progress, "another server" means any server except the attacked server.
      local_text: 如果当前或先前位于一台服务器——无论是其根目录中还是保护此服务器——的一张卡牌上的能力涉及“另一台服务器”，则其含义是除了根据规则{ref:rule_this_server}所诠释的“本服务器”以外的任意服务器。如果一张卡牌上的能力涉及选择一台服务器，则与之相关联的能力中的“另一台服务器”指的是除了所选服务器以外的任意服务器。如果以上两种情况都不适用，而当前有一次正在进行的潜袭，则“另一台服务器”指的是除了被攻击的服务器以外的任意服务器。
