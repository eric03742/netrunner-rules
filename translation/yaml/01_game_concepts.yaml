    - rule: rule_cost_calculation
      text: If a quantity in a cost is subject to effects modifying its value, determine the final value of that quantity by taking its default value, applying each effect that increases the cost, and then applying each effect that lowers the cost. Finally, if the value determined by this process is less than 0, set the value to 0.
      local_text: 如果一个费用中的某个数量会受到改变其数值的效果的影响，则在确定该数量的最终数值时，先取其默认值，然后逐个应用使该费用增加的效果，再逐个应用使该费用降低的效果。最后，如果以此过程得出的数值小于0，则将该数值设为0。
    - rule: rule_cost_quantities
      text: Some abilities calculate a quantity using phrases like "for each", "for every", or "plus". Any time such a calculation appears in a cost, the result of that calculation is determined at the time the cost is to be paid. The result is taken as an aggregate, so that paying the cost is a single instance of whatever was paid. Note that additional costs ({ref:rule_nested_cost}) are not aggregated with other costs. See also {ref:Subsec_quantities_and_sets} for rules about calculated quantities that appear in other contexts.
      examples:
      - text: The Runner approaches a server protected by 3 advanced pieces of ice and with a rezzed {card:Cayambe Grid} in its root. They pay the nested cost in {card:Cayambe Grid}'s ability. This cost is 1 payment of 6[c], not 3 payments of 2[c], so this only meets the trigger condition for 1 instance of {card:GameNET}'s ability.
        local_text: 潜袭者接驳有3层已推进的防火墙保护、且根目录中有已激活的{card:卡扬贝网阵}的服务器，并支付{card:卡扬贝网阵}的能力中的内部费用。此费用是1次支付6[c]，而非分3次支付2[c]，因此只满足一次{card:游网}能力的触发条件。
      local_text: 一些能力在计算数量时会使用“每个”、“每有”或“加”等词语。当在一个费用中出现此类计算时，该计算的结果会在支付费用时确定。计算结果是一个总和，因此无论支付何种费用，支付行为都是一次性完成的。注意额外费用（{ref:rule_nested_cost}）不会与其他的费用合并计算。有关在其他场景下出现的计算数量的规则，另请参见{ref:Subsec_quantities_and_sets}。
    - rule: rule_cost_x
      text: Some costs contain the variable X. Before a player pays such a cost, they choose and announce a positive integer or 0 to be the value for X. The chosen value must follow any applicable restrictions.
      examples:
      - text: '{card:Psychographics} is an operation with a play cost of X. It also has the ability, "X must be equal to or less than the number of tags the Runner has." If the Runner has 3 tags, the Corp can choose 0, 1, 2, or 3 as the value for X when they play {card:Psychographics}.'
        local_text: '{card:心理统计分析}是一个打出费用为X的事务，且具有能力“X必须等于或少于潜袭者所具有的锁定标记数量。”如果潜袭者拥有3枚锁定标记，则公司在打出{card:心理统计分析}时可以选择0、1、2或3作为X的数值。'
      local_text: 一些费用中包含变量X。玩家在支付一个此类费用之前必须先选择并宣告一个正整数或0作为X的数值。被选择的数值必须符合所有适用的限制。
    - rule: rule_cost_x_out_of_context
      text: If an ability needs to know the value of a cost in a context where that cost is not being paid, treat any X that appears in that cost as 0.
      local_text: 如果一项能力需要在并不支付某个费用的场景下确定该费用的数值，则出现在该费用中的任何X都会被视为0。
    - rule: rule_alternate_payment
      text: Some abilities modify a cost by allowing a player to pay part or all of that cost in an alternate way. This does not change the value of the cost, but gives the player an additional option when deciding how to pay that cost.
      examples:
      - text: The Corp rezzes {card:Biawak}, which has the ability "You can forfeit 1 agenda as you rez this ice to pay for 10[c] of its rez cost." and a rez cost of 14[c]. The Corp chooses to pay {card:Biawak}'s rez cost by spending 2[c] from their credit pool, spending 2[c] from a {card:Mahkota Langit Grid}, and forfeiting 1 agenda.
        local_text: 公司激活{card:巨蜥}，该卡牌具有能力“激活本防火墙时，你可以废除1个议案以支付其激活费用中的10[c]。”且激活费用为14[c]。公司选择花费其信用池中的[c]、花费{card:天冕网阵}上的2[c]并废除1个议案以支付{card:巨蜥}的激活费用。
      local_text: 一些能力会允许玩家以另一种方式支付某个费用的一部分或全部，从而修改该费用。这并不会改变该费用的数值，只会在玩家决定如何支付该费用时给予该玩家一个额外的选项。
    - rule: rule_install_and_rez_reducing_total
      text: An ability that instructs the Corp to install and rez a card can also reduce the "total" cost to do so. This use of "total" indicates that the Corp can divide the modifier between the install cost and the rez cost of the relevant card. When such a modifier applies, the Corp declares a number of credits by which to reduce the install cost and a number of credits by which to reduce the rez cost. This declaration is made at the beginning of {ref:rule_steps_installing_pay_install_cost}, before calculating the value of the install cost, and the numbers declared this way must be nonnegative numbers whose sum is equal to the number of credits specified by the original "total" modifier. The respective costs are then lowered by the declared amounts, following the normal procedure described in {ref:rule_cost_calculation}.
      examples:
      - text: The Corp uses the ability on {card:Tucana} to install and rez a copy of {card:Logjam} from R&D, paying a total of 3[c] less. They install the {card:Logjam} protecting a server that already has 1 piece of ice protecting it, meaning that without the "total of 3[c] less" modifier, the install cost would be 1[c] and the rez cost would be 6[c]. The Corp applies 1[c] of the discount to the install cost and 2[c] to the rez cost, leaving a final install cost of 0[c] and a final rez cost of 4[c].
        local_text: 公司使用{card:巨嘴鸟}上的能力，安装并激活研发中心中的一张{card:阻塞}，总费用减3[c]。公司将{card:阻塞}安装到一台已有1层防火墙保护的服务器，这意味着在没有“总费用减3[c]”的修改效果的条件下，其安装费用应为1[c]且激活费用应为6[c]。公司将修改效果中的1[c]应用于安装费用，并将另外2[c]应用于激活费用，使得最终的安装费用变为0[c]、激活费用变为4[c]。
      local_text: 指示公司安装并激活一张卡牌的能力可以同时减少如此做的“总”费用。此处的“总”意味着公司可以将该修改效果在相关卡牌的安装费用与激活费用之间分配。当此类修改效果生效时，公司声明安装费用所减少的信用点数量与激活费用所减少的信用点数量。此声明发生在{ref:rule_steps_installing_pay_install_cost}的开始、计算安装费用的数值之前，且以此方式所声明的数值必须是非负数，其总和必须等于原本的“总”修改效果所指定的信用点的数量。随后，这些费用依照{ref:rule_cost_calculation}中所述的通常流程，分别减少所声明的数量。
    local_text: 一个费用的实际内容有可能取决于游戏状态。能力可以修改其自身的费用、修改某些类型或符合某些条件的费用，也可以包含需要被计算的费用。

    - rule: rule_inherent_cost_in_ability
      text: The presence of an install cost, rez cost, or play cost does not change the optional or mandatory status of an ability. If an effect directs a player to install, rez, or play a card, they must pay the associated cost if able. If they cannot, the card is not installed, rezzed, or played.
      local_text: 安装费用、激活费用或打出费用的存在与否并不改变一个能力的强制或可选状态。如果一个效果指示玩家安装、激活或打出一张卡牌，则该玩家在能够支付时必须支付相关的费用。如果其无法支付，则该卡牌不会被安装、激活或打出。
    - rule: rule_inherent_and_additional_cost
      text: If an effect directs a player to install, rez, or play a card, but doing so has an additional cost, the player is not forced to pay the additional cost. If they decline to do so, they do not pay the install, rez, or play cost either, and the card is not installed, rezzed, or played.
      local_text: 如果一个效果指示玩家安装、激活或打出一张卡牌，但是此操作具有额外费用，则该玩家不会被迫使支付此额外费用。如果该玩家拒绝这么做，则其无需支付安装、激活或打出费用，同时该卡牌也不会被安装、激活或打出。
    - rule: rule_inherent_cost_aggregates
      text: When a player takes an action that plays or installs one or more cards and has no other effects, the play cost or install cost of each of those cards is considered to have been spent to take that action, even though other steps take place between initiating the action and paying that cost.
      examples:
      - text: 'The Corp has {card:Jeeves Model Bioroids} rezzed, and uses the basic action "[Click]: Play an operation." to play {card:Blue Level Clearance}. Both the click spent for the cost of the basic action and the click spent for {card:Blue Level Clearance}''s additional cost count as clicks spent to take the "[Click]: Play an operation." action.'

      local_text: 当玩家执行一个能够打出或安装一张或多张卡牌、且没有其它效果的行动时，这些卡牌的打出费用或安装费用都会被视作为执行该行动所花费的费用，即使在发起该行动与支付该费用之间发生了其他步骤。
    local_text: 游戏中主要有六种类型的费用：安装费用（主要用于硬件、程序与资源，还会在安装防火墙时产生）、打出费用（主要用于事务和事件）、激活费用（主要用于资产、升级与防火墙）、付费能力的触发费用、额外费用、以及内部费用。

In an ability with a nested cost of a form described in {ref:rule_nested_cost_may}, treat "otherwise" as an "if [you/they] do not" clause attached to the same cost. Conversely, in an ability with a nested cost of a form described in {ref:rule_nested_cost_unless}, treat "otherwise" as an "if [you/they] do" clause attached to the same cost. Note that "otherwise" can also appear in the context of other types of conditions, and does not by itself indicate a nested cost.
      local_text: 一些能力会使用用语“否则”表示根据内部费用的支付与否应结算不同的指示。在拥有形式如规则{ref:rule_nested_cost_may}所述的内部费用的能力中，“否则”视为带有相同费用的“如果[你/其]未如此做”分句。反之，在带有形式如规则{ref:rule_nested_cost_unless}所述的内部费用的能力中，“否则”视为带有相同费用的“如果[你/其]如此做”分句。注意“否则”也可以出现在其它类型条件的上下文当中，其本身并不表示一个内部费用。
