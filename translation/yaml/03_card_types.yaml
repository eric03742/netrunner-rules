    text: Ice are among the card types that have strength. An ice's strength determines which icebreakers are allowed to interface with it. See {ref:subsec_icebreakers}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_strength_modification_duration
      text: If an ability modifies the strength of a piece of ice for the remainder of a run, and that ability resolves during an encounter outside of a run, the modification instead lasts for the remainder of that encounter.
      examples:
      - text: The Runner accesses and encounters an {card:Archangel} in HQ with {card:Gang Sign}. The Runner uses {card:Devil Charm} to lower the strength of {card:Archangel}. That strength reduction would normally last for the remainder of the current run, but since no run is in progress, it instead lasts for the remainder of the encounter.
        local_text: 潜袭者使用{card:帮派标志}读取并遭遇总部中的{card:大天使}。潜袭者使用{card:恶魔护符}降低{card:大天使}的强度。通常情况下，该强度减少效果应持续至本次潜袭的剩余时间结束，但由于当前没有正在进行的潜袭，因此变为持续至本次遭遇的剩余时间结束。
      local_text: 如果一项能力会在一次潜袭的剩余时间内修改一层防火墙的强度，但该能力在潜袭之外的一次遭遇中结算，则这一修改效果变为持续至该次遭遇结束。
    local_text: 防火墙是具有强度的卡牌类型之一。防火墙的强度决定了哪些破解器能够与之对接。参见{ref:subsec_icebreakers}。
  - subsection: rule_ice_trash_cost
    text: Some ice have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an ice with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that ice. See {ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_access
      text: Unlike assets, upgrades, and agendas, ice are not normally accessed while installed. Encountering a piece of ice does not entail accessing that ice and does not give the Runner an opportunity to pay its trash cost.
      local_text: 与资产、升级和议案不同，已安装的防火墙通常情况下是不会被读取的。遭遇一层防火墙并不会导致读取该防火墙，也不会给予潜袭者支付其销毁费用的机会。
    local_text: 一些防火墙具有销毁费用。如果潜袭者读取一层具有销毁费用的防火墙，则其可以支付此销毁费用以销毁该防火墙。参见{ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}。
  - rule: rule_ice_install_cost
    text: Ice are the only Corp cards with install costs. The install cost of a piece of ice is not a printed value but instead a calculated value based on the number of other ice already protecting the relevant server. See {ref:rule_install_cost}.
    local_text: 防火墙是唯一具有安装费用的公司卡牌。一层防火墙的安装费用并不是一个印刷数值，而是根据其他已安装用于保护相关服务器的防火墙数量，计算得出的一个数值。参见{ref:rule_install_cost}。
  - rule: rule_ice_subroutine
    text: Ice are the only cards with subroutines. See {ref:sec_subroutines}.
    local_text: 防火墙是唯一具有子进程的卡牌。参见{ref:sec_subroutines}。

      local_text: 一些事务具有子类型{subtype:局势}。作为其能力的一部分，{subtype:局势}事务会防止其自身被销毁，直到另一个{subtype:局势}事务或事件被打出，抑或是潜袭者窃取了一个议案。当上述的其中之一发生时，当前活动的{subtype:局势}会在下一个检查点中被销毁。参见{ref:rule_play_not_trashed_until}。
    - rule: rule_operation_lockdown
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:lockdown}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:lockdown} operations prevent themselves from being trashed until the start of the Corp's next turn after the operation is played.
