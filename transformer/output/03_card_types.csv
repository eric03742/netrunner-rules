rule_program_memory,"3.9.3.a. Installing a program does not permanently consume memory. The program claims its designated quantity of memory units until it becomes uninstalled, at which point those memory units become available for use by other programs.",,
rule_program_install_exceed_memory_limit,"3.9.3.b. When the Runner installs a program that would increase the total memory cost of installed programs over their memory limit, they must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of installed programs including the new program will not exceed their memory limit. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.",,
rule_program_other_exceed_memory_limit,"3.9.3.c. If the Runner's memory limit decreases below the total memory cost of installed programs, or if the total memory cost of installed programs increases above the memory limit for any reason other than installing another program, the Runner must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of the remaining programs does not exceed their memory limit. This occurs during the next checkpoint after the memory limit is exceeded. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.",,
rule_program_memory_not_a_cost,"3.9.3.d. A program's memory cost is not a cost. It cannot be increased, lowered, ignored, or otherwise modified by abilities that affect costs to install programs.",,

rule_icebreaker_interface_strength,3.9.5.g. The Runner can only use an interface ability on an {subtype:icebreaker} if the {subtype:icebreaker} has strength greater than or equal to the strength of the encountered ice.,,
rule_icebreaker_interface_subtype,"3.9.5.h. If an interface ability specifies that it affects a particular subtype of ice, then that ability can only be used on a piece of ice that has the specified subtype.
