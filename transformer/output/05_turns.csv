During the {term: draw phase}, the Corp draws the top card of R&D into HQ; during the {term: action phase}, the Corp spends [click]s to perform actions; during the {term: discard phase}, the Corp discards until the number of cards in HQ does not exceed their maximum hand size. Once the Corp's turn ends, the Runner's turn begins.",,
rule_runner_turn_phases,"5.1.3. The Runner's turn consists of two phases. During the {term: action phase}, the Runner spends [click]s to perform actions; during the {term: discard phase}, the Runner discards until the number of cards in their grip does not exceed their maximum hand size.
