See {ref:sec_host}.",,
rule_play_area_not_installed_hosted,"4.6.5.h. Some cards can host other cards without installing them. In this type of host relationship, both the host card and the hosted card are in the play area, but the hosted card is not installed and thus not active. See {ref:sec_host}.",,

rule_this_server,"4.6.6.i. Some cards refer to the server where they are located (or the central server corresponding to the zone where they are located) using the phrase ""this server"". If an ability is initiated by a trigger condition or cost involving the ability's source card moving from a server, its root, or protecting it to another server or to a location not associated with any server, treat ""this server"" as referring to the server associated with the previous location of the card throughout resolution of that ability. If an ability moves its source card while it is resolving, continue to interpret ""this server"" based on the card's previous location.",,
rule_this_server-1-example,"The Runner trashes a rezzed {card:Warroid Tracker}. This meets the trigger condition of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s ability, but by the time a checkpoint is resolved and an instance of the ability would become pending, {card:Warroid Tracker} itself is no longer installed. The use of ""this server"" in the trigger condition still refers to the server from which {card:Warroid Tracker} was trashed, not to the server of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s new location in Archives.",,
rule_this_server-2-example,"The Corp uses the ability granted by {card:ZATO City Grid} to trash {card:Border Control} and resolve its first subroutine. The phrase ""this server"" in that subroutine refers to the server from which the {card:Border Control} was trashed. However, {card:Border Control} is no longer protecting that server, so it is not included in the number of ice counted.",,
rule_this_server-3-example,"The Corp uses {card:Nanisivik Grid} to turn a facedown {card:Border Control} in Archives faceup and resolve its first subroutine. {card:Border Control} was not moved between servers, so ""this server"" in that subroutine refers to Archives.",,
rule_another_server,"4.6.6.j. If an ability on a card currently or previously located in a server, its root, or protecting it  refers to ""another server"", this means any server except ""this server"" as interpreted by {ref:rule_this_server}. If a card's abilities involve choosing a server, ""another server"" in a linked ability means any server except the chosen server. If neither of the previous cases apply and a run is in progress, ""another server"" means any server except the attacked server.",,
rule_host_server,"4.6.6.k. If an ability on an object uses the phrase ""this server"", and that object is hosted on another object (see {ref:sec_host}), the server referred to is the server of the host object.",,
subsec_central_servers,4.6.7. Central Servers,,
rule_three_central_servers,"4.6.7.a. The Corp has three {term:central servers} at all times. Each central server corresponds to one of the Corp's zones: HQ corresponds to the Corp's hand, R&D corresponds to the Corp's deck, and Archives corresponds to the Corp's discard pile.",,

The Corp's discard pile is placed in the play area to indicate the location of Archives relative to other servers, but the cards in the discard pile are not installed.

rule_separate_remote_servers,"4.6.8.c. Cards installed in the roots of separate remote servers are placed in a vertical orientation in a row extending away from the central servers to indicate the locations of the remote servers relative to other servers.

rule_remote_server_existence,"4.6.8.d. A remote server exists as long as there is at least one card in the root of or protecting it. A remote server can be made up of only ice protecting it, only cards installed in it, or a combination of both.",,
rule_remote_server_cease_to_exist,"4.6.8.e. During checkpoints, a remote server ceases to exist if there are no cards installed in its root and no cards installed protecting it. If a server ceases to exist during a run against it, then the run ends after any currently open paid ability window closes. Unless the run has already been declared either successful or unsuccessful, it is neither. See {ref:rule_server_ceases_to_exist}.",,
rule_limit_remote_servers,"4.6.8.f. Some abilities limit the number of remote servers. While such an ability is active, the Corp cannot create a new remote server if this would raise the total number of remote servers above the specified limit. During {ref:step_checkpoint_card_restrictions} of each checkpoint, if there are more remote servers than an active limit allows, the Corp player chooses a number of servers equal to the limit. The checkpoint then trashes all cards in the root of and protecting each remote server that was not chosen.",,
rule_limit_remote_servers-1-example,"The Corp's identity is {card:Earth Station: SEA Headquarters}, which has the ability ""Limit 1 remote server."" If any remote servers exist, the Corp cannot create a new remote server.",,

rule_ice_ordered,4.6.9.a. An installed piece of ice is arranged in a horizontal position in front of the server it is protecting. Ice are ordered within the play area. The location of a piece of ice is defined by the server it is protecting and the number of other pieces of ice between it and the server.,,
rule_innermost_ice,"4.6.9.b. If there is no other ice between the server and a piece of ice, that ice is the innermost piece of ice. If there is no ice farther from the server than a piece of ice, that ice is the outermost piece of ice. If there is only one piece of ice protecting a server, that ice is both the innermost and the outermost piece of ice.",,
rule_ice_same_position,"4.6.9.c. If two pieces of ice protecting two different servers share the same number of ice between them and their respective servers, those pieces of ice are considered to be in the same position.",,
rule_ice_install_outermost,"4.6.9.d. When the Corp installs a piece of ice protecting a server, they must place it in the outermost position protecting that server. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.",,
rule_ice_move,"4.6.9.e. If the number of other ice between a piece of ice and the server changes, its position will change accordingly, moving either closer or farther from the server. If this occurs while that ice is being approached, encountered, or passed during a run, the Runner's position attacking the server changes in the same way.",,
sec_bank,4.7. Bank,,
rule_bank_counter_supply,4.7.1. The {term:bank} is an inactive zone shared by both players. It holds an unlimited supply of counters for use during gameplay.,,

rule_set_aside_zone_passthrough,"4.8.3. An ability cannot see the set-aside zone unless it specifically sets objects aside or refers to set-aside objects. Outside of these cases, cards moved into another zone from the set-aside zone are treated as though they entered that zone directly from their location prior to being set aside.",,
rule_set_aside_zone_passthrough-1-example,"The Runner is playing as {card:Exile} and plays Test Run, searching their heap for a program. Although the program is set aside before being installed, {card:Exile}'s ability treats it as though it were installed directly from the heap, and so {card:Exile} will draw a card.",,
rule_searched_cards_set_aside,"4.8.4. Cards found during a search are set aside facedown while the search completes (in particular, while any deck that was searched is shuffled). See {ref:sec_searching_cards}.",,
rule_set_aside_hosted_counters_trash_ability,4.8.5. Some paid abilities with a trigger cost that uninstalls or forfeits the ability's source card need to refer to or act on that card's hosted cards or counters. These abilities set aside the hosted cards or counters as the trigger cost is paid. See {ref:rule_trash_ability_keeps_track_of_hosted_objects}.,,
rule_set_aside_default_faceup,4.8.6. Cards set aside by a card ability are faceup unless the ability specifically instructs that they be set aside facedown.,,

rule_facedown_set_aside_distinct_groups-1-example,"The Runner accesses the top card of R&D and does not steal or trash it. On the next turn, the Corp uses {card:Daily Business Show} to draw that card and 1 other card simultaneously, but must put 1 of the drawn cards on the bottom of R&D. While resolving the draw, the cards are set aside facedown, so the Corp can shuffle them. They do not have to tell the Runner whether the previously-accessed card ends up in HQ or on the bottom of R&D.",,
sec_removed_from_game,4.9. Remove from the Game,,
rule_removed_from_game_zone,4.9.1. The {term:removed-from-game zone} is an inactive zone shared by both players. It is used to take cards out of any player's control until the end of the game.,,
